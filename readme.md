# AutoCD Go - Directory Inheritance for CLI Applications

Finally solve the 50-year Unix limitation: when you navigate directories in a CLI application, inherit that final location in your shell when the app exits.

## The Problem

You're in `/home/user` and run a file manager, editor, or navigation tool. You browse to `/home/user/projects/awesome-project/src/components` and then exit the application. You're back in `/home/user`. You've lost your final location.

This happens with vim, ranger, fzf, and countless other CLI tools. It's been a limitation since the dawn of Unix.

## The Solution

AutoCD Go is a simple library that lets your CLI application "inherit" its final directory to the parent shell. Add one line to your application's exit handler:

```go
autocd.ExitWithDirectory("/path/to/final/directory")
```

When your app exits, the user gets a shell in that directory. Finally.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
go get github.com/codinganovel/autocd-go
```

### Basic Usage

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/codinganovel/autocd-go"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Your application logic here
    // User navigates around, final location is in currentDir
    currentDir := "/path/to/final/directory"
    
    // When ready to exit, inherit the directory
    if err := autocd.ExitWithDirectory(currentDir); err != nil {
        // Fallback to normal exit on any error
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    // This line never executes on success
}
```

### With Command Line Flag

```go
package main

import (
    "flag"
    "os"
    "github.com/codinganovel/autocd-go"
)

func main() {
    var enableAutoCD = flag.Bool("autocd", false, "Change to directory on exit")
    flag.Parse()
    
    app := NewMyApp()
    app.Run()
    
    // Only use autocd if requested and directory changed
    if *enableAutoCD && app.FinalDirectory() != app.StartDirectory() {
        autocd.ExitWithDirectory(app.FinalDirectory())
    }
    
    os.Exit(0)
}
```

## How It Works

The library uses a clever but simple approach:

1. **Creates a POSIX shell script** that changes to your target directory
2. **Replaces the current process** with `/bin/sh` executing this script via `syscall.Exec`
3. **The script changes directory** and then replaces itself with the user's shell
4. **User gets their preferred shell** in the final directory

From the user's perspective, they just run your app and end up where they navigated to.

## Advanced Usage

For more control, use the advanced function:

```go
opts := &autocd.Options{
    SecurityLevel: autocd.SecurityStrict,  // Extra path validation
    DebugMode:     true,                   // Verbose logging
    Shell:         "zsh",                  // Force specific shell
    TempDir:       "/custom/temp",         // Custom temp directory (also cleaned)
}

err := autocd.ExitWithDirectoryAdvanced("/target/path", opts)
```

## Shell Depth Warnings

AutoCD automatically warns when you have many nested shells from navigation:

```
üí° Tip: You have 15 nested shells from navigation.  
For better performance, consider opening a fresh terminal.
```

This feature uses the `SHLVL` environment variable to detect shell nesting depth. Disable warnings if needed:
```go
opts := &autocd.Options{DisableDepthWarnings: true}
```

### Guaranteed Exit

If you want to guarantee your process exits one way or another:

```go
autocd.ExitWithDirectoryOrFallback("/target/path", func() {
    fmt.Println("AutoCD failed, exiting normally")
    os.Exit(0)
})
// Never returns
```

## Platform Support

- **Linux** - bash, zsh, fish, dash, sh
- **macOS** - bash, zsh, fish, dash, sh  
- **BSD** - sh, bash, zsh

The library automatically detects your shell from the `SHELL` environment variable, with automatic fallback to `/bin/sh` if the shell is invalid or missing.

**Note:** AutoCD Go is now focused on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS, BSD). Windows support has been removed to simplify the architecture and focus on the core Unix use case where directory inheritance is most valuable.

## Security

AutoCD includes built-in security features:

- **Path validation** ensures directories exist and are accessible (execute permission required)
- **Shell injection protection** using single-quote escaping for all paths and shell commands
- **Configurable security levels** from permissive to strict
- **Automatic cleanup** of temporary scripts via periodic removal on subsequent runs

Choose your security level:
- `SecurityNormal` (default) - Path validation, null byte check, directory verification
- `SecurityStrict` - Character whitelist, length limits, comprehensive validation
- `SecurityPermissive` - Minimal validation when you handle security yourself

## Error Handling

The library never crashes your application. On any error, it returns an error and your app can fallback to normal exit:

```go
if err := autocd.ExitWithDirectory("/path"); err != nil {
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Directory inheritance failed: %v\n", err)
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Final directory was: %s\n", "/path")
    os.Exit(0)  // Normal exit
}
```

## Real-World Examples

### File Manager
```go
// When user presses 'q' to quit
if fm.autoCDEnabled && fm.currentDir != fm.startDir {
    autocd.ExitWithDirectory(fm.currentDir)
}
os.Exit(0)
```

### Directory Picker
```go
// After user selects a directory
selectedDir := showDirectoryPicker()
autocd.ExitWithDirectory(selectedDir)
```

### Interactive Shell/REPL
```go
// When user types 'exit'
currentWorkingDir, _ := os.Getwd()
autocd.ExitWithDirectory(currentWorkingDir)
```

## Environment Variables

- `AUTOCD_DEBUG=1` - Enable debug output
- `SHELL` - Override shell detection

## Dependencies

None. AutoCD uses only the Go standard library.

I've included both licenses with the repo, do what you know is right. The licensing works by assuming you're operating under good faith.

## Finally

After 50 years, CLI applications can finally tell the shell where they've been. Your users will love you for it.
